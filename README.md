# MegaSD
```
go get github.com/bodgit/megasd/...
```
To import an existing database generated by the [C# tool](https://github.com/Terraonion-dev/GameDBManagerMD):
```
megasd import /path/to/db.xml
```
_(This will need the XML file and the original PNG image files.)_

You can then scan your Micro SD card and generate the metadata:
```
megasd scan /Volumes/MEGADRIVE
```
The tool uses a small SQLite database, the location of which defaults to `$PWD/megasd.db`.
You can pass a `--db` flag or set the environment variable `$MEGASD_DB` to put this file somewhere else.
